title: About Us

---

We are avid home gardeners located in southern NJ. We have grown many different 🍉fruits, 🥬vegetables, 🌻flowers, 🍃herbs, and 🌱plants. Through out this journey, we learned many things about growing plants.  

We hope to share information about our experiments, what we have learned, tools, and fertilizers to help those who also want to grow all kinds🍆🥦🥒🍇 in their backyard. We have plans to provide organic fertilizers, soil mixes, seeds, and vermicompost. 

Please check out our articles, products, and etsy store. If you have any questions, contact us at our email listed on the contact page.
